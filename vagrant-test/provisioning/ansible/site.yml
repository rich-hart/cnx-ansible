# In site.yml, we include a playbook that defines our entire infrastructure. 
# Note this is SUPER short, because itâ€™s just including some other playbooks. 
# Remember, playbooks are nothing more than lists of plays:

#---
#  file: site.yml
#- include: startup.yml
---
# archive.yml
- hosts: all
  remote_user: vagrant
  sudo: yes

  handlers:
    - name: restart memcached
      service: name=memcached state=restarted

  tasks:
    #- include: library/setup.yml
    #- include: library/plxslt.yml
    - include: library/install_modules.yml
#    - include: library/archive.yml

#- include: webservers.yml
#- include: dbservers.yml
