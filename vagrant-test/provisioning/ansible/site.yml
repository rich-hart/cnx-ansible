# In site.yml, we include a playbook that defines our entire infrastructure. 
# Note this is SUPER short, because itâ€™s just including some other playbooks. 
# Remember, playbooks are nothing more than lists of plays:

---
#  file: site.yml
#- include: startup.yml
- include: library/archive.yml

#- include: webservers.yml
#- include: dbservers.yml
